/**
 * Decide which notification a finished recording/processing job should fire
 * (#bug2/#bug3). Pure so it can be unit-tested without the IPC/route machinery
 * around it in useRecording.
 *
 * - `note-ready`: notes were generated (auto_summarize on, or the deferred
 *   Generate-notes/reprocess finished), OR a transcription failure that still
 *   wrote a note — either way there's a note to open.
 * - `transcript-ready`: transcript-only note (auto_summarize off → no notes
 *   generated) — prompt the user to generate notes rather than claim it's
 *   ready. This is the correctly-timed replacement for the old premature
 *   meeting-end "Summarise?" prompt.
 *
 * A failed transcription is deliberately routed to `note-ready` (with the
 * caller's `failed` flag), NOT `transcript-ready`: there's nothing to summarise
 * on a failed transcript, so we never offer "generate notes" there.
 *
 * `notesAlreadyExist` covers the continue-recording (append) case: the backend
 * always prints SUMMARY_SKIPPED for an append (deferring to on-demand
 * regenerate), so `notesGenerated` is false — but the note it appended to
 * already has notes (now stale). Prompting "generate notes?" for a note that
 * already has them is wrong, so a note that already has notes is `note-ready`.

 * Subtle: the backend only ever writes `notes_generated: false` (a transcript-

 * written `true`. So "has notes" is `notes_generated !== false`, NOT
 * `notes_generated === true` (which is always false and was the ineffective
 * first fix). Guard on meetingData presence: when the completion event carries
 * no meetingData (the rare list-lookup-failed fallback, and the reprocess/report
 * paths), return false so we fall back to the transient `notesGenerated` signal
 * rather than defaulting a transcript-only note to "has notes". `notes_stale`
 * is NOT a substitute — an append sets it unconditionally, including on

 *   focused on this note, or focused on /processing watching it finish. Focus,
 *   not visibilityState: `visibilityState` stays 'visible' for a window shown
 *   behind the meeting app (wrongly suppressing); `hasFocus()` is false whenever
